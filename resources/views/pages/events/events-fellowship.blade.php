    <p>SCMAP's activities and events are also a place for its members to network, connect and exchange ideas. In addition to our regular events, SCMAP also holds fellowship activities where members can have fun while getting to know their fellow supply chain professionals.</p>
    <p>In the past years, SCMAP has organized the following fellowship activities:</p>
    <p>Walk the Watershed</p>
    <p>SCMAP, in partnership with the Philippine Disaster Recovery Fund and with the support of Smart Communications Inc., mounted Walk the Watershed in 2014. This CSR activity saw SCMAP members trek to Casili Elementary School in Montalban, Rizal, to give raincoats, slippers and school supplies to its students and teachers. Apart from knowing of the important role the Marikina Watershed plays in preventing floods in Metro Manila, the participants had a chance to meet the school's students and teachers, and also bonded in a fun and meaningful way.</p>
    <p>SCMAP Bowling Tournament</p>
    <p>Usually held in the first quarter of the month, the SCMAP Bowling Tournament sees players from SCMAP member
        companies face off in a battle of pin falls and strikes.</p>
    <p>SCMAP Christmas Fellowship</p>
    <p>Despite the hectic schedule that supply chain professionals face at the end of the year - or as they call it, peak time - the SCMAP Christmas Fellowship is a well-attended affair to cap off the year. With overflowing food, drinks and entertainment, it is an occasional for SCMAP members and friends to kick back and celebrate the Christmas spirit.</p>
