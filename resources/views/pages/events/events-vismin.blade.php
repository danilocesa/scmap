         <p>With the Philippines becoming increasingly connected, how a business fares in Visayas and Mindanao has never been more important. Any supply chain professional knows that for his operation to become a nationwide success, he has to get his strategy in these regions right. With new infrastructure and new growth centers coming up, there's never been a more exciting time for Vismin - but how can a supply chain professional take advantage of this? What are the opportunities awaiting the region? What are the challenges? And how will all this affect our efforts to grow and evolve the national economy?</p>
         <p>The SCMAP Vismin Supply Chain Conference aims to provide insight into these questions, and more. SCMAP's first conference outside of Manila will be held on 16 May 2015, from 8am to 5pm, at the Summit Circle Hotel in Cebu. Among the topics include: the economic situation in the Vismin region, and how it relates to national development; the challenges stakeholders face when it comes to infrastructure; and how Cebu plays its role as the country's second logistics hub.</p>
         <p>The conference is not just limited to delegates from Visayas and Mindanao, though, as the participants of this year's Logistics Immersion Course will be attending as well. The Vismin Supply Chain Conference, therefore, is an opportunity for supply chain professionals across the country to learn from each other, exchange ideas, and network.</p>
