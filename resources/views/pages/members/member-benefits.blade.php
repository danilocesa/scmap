      usually, a forum or product presentation is conducted, plus copy of minutes and relevant papers.<br />

      member companies, and for individual members<br />

      increases or other issues<br />

      <br />Benefits to Company Operations. Over the years, member companies have greatly benefited from successful efforts by SCMAP at reducing, containing and postponing logistics cost increases. Cost avoidance benefits to the current members run in the hundreds of millions of pesos. SCMAP initiatives also helped prevent disadvantageous regulations and impositions, such as total truck ban in the expressways, odd-even traffic scheme, valuation surcharge in shipping, shipping deregulation provisions unfair to cargo owners, and the implementation of a disadvantageous executive order on ports cargo handling. SCMAP has also encouraged government to promote RORO transport.
