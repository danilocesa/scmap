    <p>About General Membership Meetings</p>
    <p>SCMAP's General Membership Meetings are held six times a year and is the primary venue for the organization's members to be updated on the latest developments, new processes and best practices within the industry. A typical GMM would include talks from government representatives, industry leaders, advocacy groups and up-and-coming businesses. Also, the GMM is a way for the organization to update its membership on its advocacies, events and activities - and of course, it provides an avenue for networking and fellowship.</p>
    <p>General Membership Meetings are typically held every February, April, June, August, October and November of every year. The November GMM also serves as the election of the board of the SCMAP national chapter. SCMAP's other chapters in Cebu and Cagayan de Oro also hold GMMs, albeit less frequently.</p>
